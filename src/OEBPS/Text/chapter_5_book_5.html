  <p class="calibre1">A/Lore names are reported in English for the puffball than for any other kind</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of mushroom. There is the fanciful 'devil's snuffbox', which recalls the cor-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">responding <i class="calibre4">chortova perechnitza</i> or 'devil's pepperpot' of the Russians. There is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'frogcheese', designating the young puffball before it dries up. There is that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">curious word 'bunt', now dying out. In the Oxford Dictionary it follows</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hard on another word, identically spelled, that is defined as 'a swelling, a pouch-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">or bag-shaped part of a net, sail, etc.', and both words are put down as of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">unknown etymology. Surely, from the swelling growth of the puffball and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the many associations of the fungi with the idea of pouches and bags and swell-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ings, we may regard these words as one.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">However, in England and throughout western Europe the distinctive associa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion of the puffball is scabrous. 'Puckfist' is the English archetype, whence de-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pend a number of variants: puff-fist, bullfist, fistball, fuzzball, pixie-puff, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">finally the cleansed and devitalized survivor of the lot, our puffball, of which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the bad-smelling origin is lost almost from memory. In human speech as in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">physical world there operates a law of entropy that saps the strength from once</p>

  <p class="calibre1">virile metaphors, until only bookworms (ourselves perhaps devitalized!) detect</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and relish with rarefied connoisseurship the faded flavors that have lain stale</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for centuries. 'Feist' was the word once commonly used for the silent flatus;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it and the noisy 'fart' are simply different phases or 'grades' of the same word,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">etymologically identical. ('Feist' rimes with 'enticed', but in 'puckfist' the V</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is short.) They correspond respectively to the French <i class="calibre4">vesse</i> and <i class="calibre4">pet.</i> Just as the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Latin <i class="calibre4">p</i> of <i class="calibre4">pater</i> corresponds to the 'f' of 'father', so the <i class="calibre4">p</i> of the French verb</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">peter</i> in ah1 likelihood corresponds to the 'f' of our English words. One of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">famous creations of the French pastry-cook is the <i class="calibre4">pet de nonne1:</i> here in this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">single term, as in a capsule, the spirit of Gallic humor was caught, though</p>

  <p class="calibre1">today it trips off the tongue of Frenchmen with no thought of its pristine</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flavor. A French wine that is <i class="calibre4">petillant</i> is one that fizzes slightly, and originally</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'to fizz' was the English verb that corresponded in scabrous meaning to the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">noun 'feist'. In the beginning the <i class="calibre4">petard</i> was an enormous <i class="calibre4">pet,</i> and he who is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">hoist by his own petard is the victim of a peculiarly personal rocket action such</p>

  <p class="calibre1">as Hieronymus Bosch actually depicted in his <i class="calibre4">Last Judgment.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">The metaphor of the silent flatus appears to have attached itself to the puffball</p>

  <p class="calibre1">i. Cf. Dutch <i class="calibre4">hoerendrcetje</i> and <i class="calibre4">nonnenfortje</i> for similar delicacies, words that, if literally rendered, would shock</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the English ear and turn the stomach.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">97</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_93"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_42">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">in earliest times, before the linguistic break-up of the Indo-European peoples.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">For the English, as we have seen, the puffball used to be the puckfist or imp's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">silent flatus. In French it is the <i class="calibre4">vesse de loup,</i> or wolf's silent flatus, and similarly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Dutch, <i class="calibre4">wolfsveest;</i> and in Danish the sources give the corresponding <i class="calibre4">ulve-fiis,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">but this is not a drawing-room word. Some Frisian islanders speak of the toad's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flatus, but the more common Frisian term is <i class="calibre4">ulefyst,</i> or owl's flatus, which</p>

  <p class="calibre1">may be traceable to an erroneous popular rendering of the Danish term. In Russia</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the genteel name for the puffball is the devil's pepperpot, as we have seen; but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">there circulates an earthier term, <i class="calibre4">bzdjukha,</i> the silent flatus. The Basques speak</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of the ass's flatus, <i class="calibre4">astaputz;</i> and in Romansch we find in the Engadine, wolf's</p>

  <p class="calibre1">flatus, <i class="calibre4">toffas d'luj,</i> and in the Surselva, <i class="calibre4">cacs tgapper,</i> or crow's droppings. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom manuals report <i class="calibre4">cuesco de lobo,</i> wolf's flatus, for the Spaniards, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we ourselves report <i class="calibre4">pedo de lobo</i> in use in the Castilian countryside. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">standard name in Italian is <i class="calibre4">vescia di lupo,</i> but in the Trentino dialect we have</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">slofa,</i> which is a low word for the <i class="calibre4">membrum virile.</i> In Catalonia we find <i class="calibre4">pet de</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Hop</i> and <i class="calibre4">pet de bou,</i> wolf's flatus and ox-flatus, this latter paralleling the English</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bullfist. By far the most interesting of all, however, are two other Catalan</p>

  <p class="calibre1">terms: <i class="calibre4">bufa del diable</i> and <i class="calibre4">bufa del dimoni. Bufa</i> like 'feist' is a silent flatus, and so</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in both these Catalan expressions we find exact equivalents of the obsolete</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English puckfist. But the ramifying interplay of semantic and phonetic associa-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions does not stop there, for in the Catalan language <i class="calibre4">bufa</i> also means 'bladder'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and a cluster of kindred things, and this transports us at once to the maze of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">meanings that we found clinging to the Irish <i class="calibre4">puca,</i> the Latin <i class="calibre4">bulga</i> and its deriva-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tives, and indeed the whole cluster <i class="calibre4">o£pogge</i> words. In Irish, according to a reliable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">source, the puffball is <i class="calibre4">cos-a-phouka,1</i> 'Puck's foot', which reminds us of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Old French word, <i class="calibre4">le bot,</i> meaning both Satan and 'toad'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the puffball vocabulary we discover a subtle interplay of sounds and mean-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ings, where strict etymologies are lost in a common pool. The idea of the devil</p>

  <p class="calibre1">underlies all-in pixie and puck and the <i class="calibre4">diable</i> and <i class="calibre4">dimoni</i> of the Catalans;</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and, as it were behind a mask, the Evil One is hidden in toad and wolf, those</p>

  <p class="calibre1">creatures steeped in terrible folk associations. The owl of the Frisians is an</p>

  <p class="calibre1">evasive substitute for the wolf, and the crow of the Surselva may hide, through</p>

  <p class="calibre1">translation and metamorphosis, the German <i class="calibre4">Krote</i> or the French <i class="calibre4">crapaud.</i> In</p>

  <p class="calibre1">addition to the devil, the scabrous exhalation of gas is everywhere - in feist,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fuzz (i.e., fizz), puff", <i class="calibre4">vesse, pet, bufa,</i> and behind the euphemistic face of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">bull and <i class="calibre4">bou,</i> and probably behind the enigmatic <i class="calibre4">Bo-</i> of B0f zsL'Ball' in 'puffball'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. See A. B. Steele, 'Fungus Folklore', in <i class="calibre4">Transactions</i> of the Edinburgh Field Naturalists' and Microscopical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Society, vol. 2, 1887, pp. 175-183.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">98</p>

  <p class="calibre1">PUFFBALLS, FILTH, AND VERMIN</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is a happy dilution of the same theme, an acceptable alliterative substitute.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In 'puff' there is the phonetic overlap with 'puck' and the semantic overlap</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with 'feist'. Like those modern clutches in automobiles that move imperceptibly</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from speed to speed, the peoples of western Europe, when they speak of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">lycoperdon, slip from sound to sound and metaphor to metaphor, under pres-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sures of primitive tabu and the modern sense of propriety. On this phenomenon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">suggestive of punning the scholars bestow the name of paronomasia. There is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in our case a pool of sounds and a pool of meanings and a pool of evasive substi-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tutes, mingling together in step with the pulsation of underlying ideas and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">emotions. Our own inquiry is keyed to the association of fungi with toads,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and here there remains one notable observation to add. So far as we know,</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">bufa</i> has never designated the toad in Catalonia. But phonetically and semantic-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ally (because of the toad's aptitude for prodigious inhalation of air and exhala-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tion), the Latin <i class="calibre4">bufo,</i> meaning toad, and the Catalan <i class="calibre4">bufa</i> are close kin,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and etymologically, though neither is derived from the other, they must both</p>

  <p class="calibre1">spring genetically from the same verbal tree. Thus there is a further strange</p>

  <p class="calibre1">analogy between 'puckfist' and <i class="calibre4">bufa del dimoni:</i> 'puck' and <i class="calibre4">bufa</i> mean 'imp'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and 'feist' respectively, but in addition each is pregnant, so to speak, with the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">latent idea of 'toad'.1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Our survey of the puckfist names has been confined to the Indo-European</p>

  <p class="calibre1">peoples and Basques, and chiefly to Europe. Think of the horizons for research</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that open up when we ask ourselves what metaphors are used for the puckfist</p>

  <p class="calibre1">elsewhere in the Eurasian land-mass, and then in the other continents. What a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">field for scholarly enterprise is here, and how learned and mad must that inspired</p>

  <p class="calibre1">scholar be, after the manner of a Norman Douglas character, who will de-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vote himself to this pursuit, his journeyirigs and questionings to be financed</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of course by some noble Foundation with a nose for the more subtile cultural</p>

  <p class="calibre1">aromas!</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Throughout the puff ball world there is present one element that we did not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">find in the <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> words, and this new element is the scatological. The puffballs,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">which in their 'frogcheese' phase make good eating, despite this virtue are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">linked throughout western Europe with the filth of hindwind. And this leads</p>

  <p class="calibre1">us into a fresh area for exploration. The High German word for 'toad' is <i class="calibre4">Krote,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">of which the etymology has defied the efforts of massive German scholarship.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. The flatus metaphor is also found in the Panjabi fungal vocabulary: <i class="calibre4">padd bahera,</i> 'gall-nut flatus", is a mush-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">room name. The <i class="calibre4">bahera</i> is a tree famous in the India trade and known in botany as 'belleric myrobalan'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">It yields a kind of gall-nut used in dyeing and tanning, and also in Indian medicine. It would be tempting to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">associate the Panjabi <i class="calibre4">padd,</i> 'flatus', with Dutch <i class="calibre4">padd,</i> 'toad', but no kinship is possible. The Panjabi word is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cognate with the two English words of the same meaning discussed on p. 97.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">99</p>

  <div class="calibre6" id="calibre_pb_95"></div>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_43">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

  <p class="calibre1">We dare not aspire to trace this word to its lair, but as a fresh approach to a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">vexed problem, we submit that German <i class="calibre4">Krote</i> is the same as the Rhineland</p>

  <p class="calibre1">word <i class="calibre4">krotz,</i> meaning originally the dung of domesticated animals; i.e., dung</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with value for the farmer. The same word appears in Flemish <i class="calibre4">krotte,</i> and it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">turns up also in the familiar French <i class="calibre4">crotte</i> and <i class="calibre4">crottin,</i> whose primary meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was also 'dung'. Indeed, if this surmise be well received, we venture further.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The French word for 'toad', <i class="calibre4">crapaud,</i> is certainly not related etymologically</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to any root meaning dung, being akin to the Provencal word <i class="calibre4">grapal,</i> but the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">precise shape that this word has taken in modern French seems to be traceable</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to popular pressures that seek to associate the loathsome creature and its name</p>

  <p class="calibre1">with <i class="calibre4">crape,</i> a French word whose scatological English counterpart is known</p>

  <p class="calibre1">wherever the English language is spoken. The Oxford Dictionary offers us a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Scottish and English dialectical word for the dung of domesticated animals,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'tath' or 'tathe', which in Norwegian and Swedish dialects becomes <i class="calibre4">tad.</i> Do</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we not here find the identical semantic transfer? Perhaps we are in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">presence of three doublets, the Germans referring to the toad as 'dung', the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">English and Scandinavians doing likewise, and the French word for toad</p>

  <p class="calibre1">being re-shaped to resemble <i class="calibre4">crape.</i> In the Danish pattern of fungal metaphors,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">we find that dung is an alternative to the toad in a pair of fungal words -</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">paddehat,</i> 'toad's hat', and <i class="calibre4">skarnhat,</i> 'dung hat'. How felicitous for our argument</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is the word 'cowpad', wherein the second element here means 'dung', but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">elsewhere as we know means 'toad'!1 On an earlier page we considered the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">possibility that 'toad', a word of unknown origin, might be descended from a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Celtic adaptation of the Latin word for 'poison', and certainly in Anglo-Saxon</p>

  <p class="calibre1">times the loathed creature was linked with venom. But on balance the Nordic</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">tad,</i> meaning 'dung', seems to us the likelier source.2</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In modern English no filthier word for the fungi exists than 'smut', the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name of the fungal parasite that afflicts corn. It is cousin to the German word</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Schtmttz,</i> 'dirt', and its evil potency comes out in its figurative use for con-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">1. 'Cowpad' is in wide use throughout the English and American countryside, and it is therefore surprising that</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neither the Oxford Dictionary nor Webster's reports it; nor do we find it in Wright's <i class="calibre4">English Dialect Dictionary.</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">Wright reports a single citation for 'pad' in the sense of'dried cow's dung as formerly used for fuel'. This citation</p>

  <p class="calibre1">is from East Anglia, and Wright declares the word obsolete.</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">2.</i> Franciscus van Sterbeeck in his <i class="calibre4">Theatrum Fungorum,</i> Antwerp, 1675, said on p. 227 that in France a certain</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushroom considered foul by him was called <i class="calibre4">la crate.</i> If true this would add striking additional evidence for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">our thesis of a common pool of words and meanings for toads, mushrooms, and excrement. We have not yet</p>

  <p class="calibre1">found corroboration for Van Sterbeeck's statement in French sources. Van Sterbeeck relied heavily on the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">great <i class="calibre4">Historia Plantarum Universalis,</i> 1650-1, of Jean Bauhin, who on p. 846 described a certain mushroom</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that he had gathered on a hill in Montbeliard called La Crotte. Did Van Sterbeeck misconstrue Bauhin's Latin</p>

  <p class="calibre1">text and think the name belonged to the mushroom? Professor Georges Becker, the great mycophile, is a</p>

  <p class="calibre1">citizen of Montbeliard, and he has confirmed to us the former existence in that city of a hill called La Crotte,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">razed to make way for railroad facilities.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">demning scabrous language. To the Englishman the two meanings of 'smut'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seem so fittingly wedded that he could not imagine things otherwise. Yet the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Englishman's disgust with fungal smut is an acquired cultural trait, not in-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stinctive in the human species. The Indians of the Valley of Mexico have always</p>

  <p class="calibre1">considered smut a culinary delicacy. The kind they use grows on maize, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'ustilago maydis' seems to be its scientific designation. But in the market place</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the Nahuatl name, <i class="calibre4">cuitlacoche,</i> circulates in Spanish too, and the best families</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Spanish descent delight in eating <i class="calibre4">cuitlacoche</i> prepared in a variety of ways.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Moreover, when English-speaking guests taste the <i class="calibre4">cuitlacoche,</i> perhaps served</p>

  <p class="calibre1">like <i class="calibre4">piroshki</i> with cocktails, it moves them to rapture — until they discover</p>

  <p class="calibre1">that they are eating smut. The Nahuatl word is built from <i class="calibre4">cuitlatl,</i> 'excrement'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Today, as we have already said, in standard High German the toad is no</p>

  <p class="calibre1">longer linked with the fungi, though traces of this association survive in Penn-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">sylvania Dutch. Yet in the German mushroom manuals we occasionally find</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Krotenschwamm</i> as a common name for the poisonous amanita pantherina.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Perhaps this is one of those mushroom names that circulate only in manuals.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">But the same word applied to the same species appeared in the treatise on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">mushrooms by Carolus Clusius published in 1601,' and we suspect that it</p>

  <p class="calibre1">was current in his day. If so, and if we are right about the source of <i class="calibre4">Krote,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">it follows that toads and dung were intermingled in the minds of simple Germans,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and both were linked with fungi in <i class="calibre4">Krotenschwamm.</i> If we have successfully</p>

  <p class="calibre1">recaptured the semantic associations and feelings of the people who used these</p>

  <p class="calibre1">humble words, then here we discover a very citadel of mycophobia, where</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toads and fungi with loathing were spewed forth on the dungheap. Against</p>

  <p class="calibre1">this background, it becomes clearer that 'frogcheese', 'toadsmeat', and the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Welsh 'toad's cheese', as well as the French <i class="calibre4">pain de crapaud,</i> hark back to excre-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">tions of toads, rather than to food that toads were supposed to eat. We have</p>

  <p class="calibre1">seen that the Surselva countryman thinks of puff balls as the droppings of crows.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">R. C. A. Prior in his treatise on English plant names, published almost a century</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ago, suggested that the stool of 'pixie-stool' referred to the devil's droppings.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. His <i class="calibre4">Rariomm Plantarum Historia</i> (Antwerp) contained a section on mushrooms of Hungary. Clusius was</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Charles de Lecluse, a Frenchman of Arras. He is sometimes called the father of scientific mycology. <i class="calibre4">Kroten-</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">schwamm</i> has appeared recently in the <i class="calibre4">Kleiner Pilzatlas</i> of H. Strohschneider, Vienna, 1948, p. 22. We have discovered</p>

  <p class="calibre1">no modem citation of the word in High German other than in mushroom manuals. Clusius' work was a treatise</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on the mushrooms of the Pannonian plain (Hungary) and he gives Krottenschwammen [sic] as the German</p>

  <p class="calibre1">name of the mushroom (amanita pantherina) that in Magyar was called <i class="calibre4">bagoly gomba,</i> or 'owl mushroom'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Thus the German word was certainly not a translation out of the Hungarian. Clusius also reports <i class="calibre4">Froschemtuel</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">[sic] as the German name for another mushroom. Here he may have been translating the Low German <i class="calibre4">poggenstul,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">thus spelled by Valerius Cordus in the middle of the i6th century when he called it to the attention of the learned</p>

  <p class="calibre1">ing, in standard High German in the time of Clusius; that they have long been obsolete; and that the compilers</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of manuals retain them by oversight.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">He was mistaken, but doubtless in the long course of English speech there</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have been others whose mycophobic thoughts turned to dung as they spat</p>

  <p class="calibre1">out the expletive 'toadstool'. When the English caricaturist devised a satirical</p>

  <p class="calibre1">coat of arms for Bonaparte, his symbol for the Corsican Devil was a toadstool,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and it sprang from dung, the lineage that he thought befitted his villain. True</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the Englishman's unfailing ignorance in fungal matters, the artist did not</p>

  <p class="calibre1">limn a deadly species, or even a fly amanita, as the reader will observe in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reproduction of this old print that we present.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Some years ago an episode took place in France that was curious for various</p>

  <p class="calibre1">reasons, and not least because it linked birds' droppings with mushrooms. On</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sunday, January 6,1926, in the village of Bombon (550 inhabitants, eleven miles</p>

  <p class="calibre1">from Melun in the Department of Seine-et-Marne) the beloved and respected</p>

  <p class="calibre1">cure of the parish church, the Abbe Desnoyers, 50 years of age, had retired to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">his sacristy after Mass when twelve persons, ten women and two men,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">strangers to the community, burst in upon him, seized, gagged, and bound him,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">threw him to the floor, and proceeded to flog him with knotted cords until</p>

  <p class="calibre1">he almost fainted. A few minutes later the twelve assailants quietly submitted</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to arrest. It developed that the twelve had come by car all the way from distant</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Bordeaux, that they were members of a religious circle known as the Groupe de</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Notre-Dame des Pleurs, that they were the disciples of the founder of this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">little sect, one Madame Marie Mesmin, formerly a concierge, and that they</p>

  <p class="calibre1">attributed Madame Mesmin's bad health to spells cast upon her by the Abbe</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Bombon across hundreds of miles of intervening countryside. One of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">two men, the street-sweeper Maurice Lourdin, at the Magistrate's hearing on</p>

  <p class="calibre1">January 24, had no trouble in identifying the Abbe Desnoyers as Satan himself,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">one of the most powerful sorcerers of the age. Only by flagellation could the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">demon that possessed this priest be exorcised. Lourdin bore witness that the priest</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Bombon had sent birds (we are not told the species, alas!) to Bordeaux</p>

  <p class="calibre1">carrying diseases. They had flown over Madame Mesmin's garden, and from</p>

  <p class="calibre1">their droppings had sprung up a crop of fungi that took obscene shapes, whose</p>

  <p class="calibre1">appalling stench had smitten all and sundry with horrible diseases.1 For a brief</p>

  <p class="calibre1">spell the Parisian press was agog with amused excitement about the happening</p>

  <p class="calibre1">in Bombon, and cabaret singers made much of it. Thirty years have passed, but</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. There may be an echo of the same association between birds' droppings and fungi in a curious theory advanced</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to explain fairy rings by a Mr. Johnson of Wetherby, England, early in the igth century. He thought they were</p>

  <p class="calibre1">caused by starlings which "when in large nights frequently alight on the ground in circles, and sometimes are</p>

  <p class="calibre1">known to sit a considerable time in these annular congregations". This reference is to be found in the edition of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Gilbert White's <i class="calibre4">Selborne</i> annotated by Captain Thomas Brown, of which the first printing appeared in 1833,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">on p. 327.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">PUFFBALLS, FILTH, AND VERMIN</p>

  <p class="calibre1"></p>

  <p class="calibre1">there are those who still remember it: Aldous Huxley has recalled for us one of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the refrains:</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Frappons, frappons, en union</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Sur le Cure de Bombon.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The account of this anachronistic episode can be found in <i class="calibre4">The Times</i> in the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">issues of January 6, 7, and 25, 1926. The obscene fungi could only have been</p>

  <p class="calibre1">stinkhorns. <i class="calibre4">The Times</i> correspondent did not remark on the number of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">assailants: twelve. With Madame Mesmin their leader, this made thirteen, the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">full complement of a witches' coven. We seem to be in the presence here of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">posthumous twitchings of witchcraft, the religion of the Horned God, and of</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the folk association of fungi with excrement.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">In the Italian language there is a word to designate a venomous snake, <i class="calibre4">scorzone,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">which is etymologically identical with one of the Spanish words for 'toad',</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">escuerzo.</i> The Basques, as we have seen on page 78, sometimes call the marasmius</p>

  <p class="calibre1">oreades the Viper-fungus', <i class="calibre4">suge-perretxiko,</i> and sometimes the <i class="calibre4">zapo-perretxiko,</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">or 'toad-fungus'. According to Clusius, in the i6th century two innocent kinds</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of mushrooms bore in German the name of <i class="calibre4">Natterschwamm,</i> or adder-fungus,1</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and the Magyar term was a translation of this - <i class="calibre4">kigyo gomba.</i> Traveling farther</p>

  <p class="calibre1">east, we have already called attention to the 'toad-fungus' and 'viper-fungus'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of Slovakian usage. Far more important is the Russian word <i class="calibre4">poganka,</i> the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">supreme expression among the Slavs of the folk association between the fungi</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and vermin. In Great Russia, <i class="calibre4">poganka</i> is a term of condescending affection for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the inedible mushrooms: the word has lost some of its sting among the myco-</p>

  <p class="calibre1">philic Russians. But this same word <i class="calibre4">poganka,</i> derived from the Latin word for</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'pagan', circulates throughout the Slavic world, and in one region or another</p>

  <p class="calibre1">it designates not inedible mushrooms but all things unclean: mice, rats, snakes,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pimples and other organic swellings and tumors, and (in Serbia) dung. The</p>

  <p class="calibre1">inedible mushrooms are unclean, they are vegetable vermin, so to speak, and</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the word used for them was also transferred to all other vermin and filth.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">The presence of pimples and tumors among these meanings arrests attention,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">for here we hark back to our familiar theme of the <i class="calibre4">pogge</i> cluster.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Farther east, in the Indo-Aryan world of Asia, the theme of the serpent</p>

  <p class="calibre1">recurs in the fungal vocabularies of various peoples, but there is no trace of the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">toad. The oldest figure in the fungal metaphors of these Eastern peoples is</p>

  <p class="calibre1">neither the hat nor the stool, but the parasol - Sanskrit <i class="calibre4">chattra.</i> Perhaps the</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><br /></p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. <i class="calibre4">Natterschwamm</i> is unrelated to the 'natterjack' (vide p. 74); the English equivalent <i class="calibre4">of Natter</i> drops the initial</p>

  <p class="calibre1">letter to become 'adder'; by contrast, what was originally an 'atterjack' in early English added an initial 'n' to</p>

  <p class="calibre1">become the 'natterjack'.</p>

  <h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_toc_45"><br /></h2>

  <p class="calibre1">earliest surviving reference to mushrooms in Sanskrit, going back several</p>

  <p class="calibre1">centuries before Christ, is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">ahi-chattra(ka],</i>&nbsp;'snake's parasol', in the text called</p>

  <p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Nirukta.</i>&nbsp;The same word is found in Pali, and in the Hindi&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sap ki chain,</i>&nbsp;all with</p>

  <p class="calibre1">the same meaning; and also the Persian&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">catr-i-mar.</i>&nbsp;Another Hindi word for the</p>

  <p class="calibre1">fungi is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sap kiroti,</i>&nbsp;'snake's bread', and a Sindhi expression is&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sapido,</i>&nbsp;a diminutive</p>

  <p class="calibre1">of&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sapu,</i>&nbsp;'snake'.1 It is curious that elsewhere than in the Indie languages we</p>

  <p class="calibre1">find the 'parasol' figure applied to fungi only in the Spanish dialect of Jocotan,</p>

  <p class="calibre1">Guatemala, as we mentioned earlier:&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sombrilla de sapo,</i>&nbsp;wherein&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sapo</i>&nbsp;means 'toad'</p>

  <p class="calibre1">and not 'snake'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">I. This Eastern word for 'snake' recalls the Spanish word for 'toad',&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sapo,</i>&nbsp;and suggests an analogy between this</p>

  <p class="calibre1">pair of words and the alternative Spanish word,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">escuerzo,</i>&nbsp;'toad', with its Italian cousin,&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">scorzone,</i>&nbsp;meaning</p>

  <p class="calibre1">'viper'. But the Spanish&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sapo</i>&nbsp;and its Eastern homonym are not directly related to each other. The Spaniards could</p>

  <p class="calibre1">have borrowed the Eastern word only from the Spanish Gypsies, who in fact use it in the sense of 'snake'.</p>

  <p class="calibre1">However, the Gypsies did not arrive in Spain until the I5th century, and the Spaniards were applying&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sapo</i></p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the toad long before then. We find the word in Don Juan Manuel's&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">Libra del Caballero et del Escudero,</i>&nbsp;written</p>

  <p class="calibre1">at the beginning of the I4th century. The Hindi word comes down from the Sanskrit&nbsp;<i class="calibre4">sarpa,</i>&nbsp;and 'serpent' belongs</p>

  <p class="calibre1">to the family.</p>
