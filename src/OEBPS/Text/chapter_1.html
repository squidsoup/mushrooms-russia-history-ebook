            <p><span class="initial">I</span> CANNOT recall the time when our mother first began to send us out into the woods and fields to gather mushrooms for the family table. In the summer of 1909, when I was almost eight and my sister was nearly seven, we were spending our summer holidays at a village called Majorenhof, near Riga on the Baltic Sea. We were surrounded by pine groves, the ground carpeted with needles and with blueberry and bilberry bushes. What a delight it was for Tanya and me to ramble through the clean, fragrant woods, filling our baskets with those aristocrats of the mushroom world, the noble <i>belye griby</i>!</p>

            <p>We were already proficient mushroom gatherers then, and we must have begun our apprenticeship long before. Our mother, Xenia Dimitrievna, was even more solicitous about her brood than most mothers, yet it never occurred to her to poison our young minds with warnings about &lsquo;toadstools&rsquo;. All Russians know the mushrooms, not by dint of study as the mycologists do, but as part of our ancient heritage, imbibed with our mother&rsquo;s milk. A Russian nursery rime, tenderly humorous, tells of the mother who sends out her toddler to look for the <i>borovik.</i> Each time he returns with the wrong kind, perhaps a good kind, perhaps bad, but never the <i>borovik.</i> Each time she repeats her previous instructions, adding however an additional line of descriptive advice. In the end, off goes Mother herself, impatiently, and there, almost on her doorstep, she discovers a family of the ones she seeks.</p>

            <p>We Russians love the whole mushroom world, and what a world it is! Almost endless in variety, every species expressing its individuality by its size and shape and stance, in the beauty of its evanescent colors, in the delicate perfection of its gills or pores or skin that are a joy to touch, and usually too in its scent and taste. The evil kinds, how they flaunt their wicked grace, like the harlots that they are! But we are fond even of them, in a way. Where is death more plainly writ than in the greenish pallor of the elegant amanita phalloides, the &lsquo;destroying angel&rsquo;? Where is to be found a better portrait of the Scarlet Woman than in Europe&rsquo;s amanita muscaria, the &lsquo;fly amanita&rsquo;? (As ofttimes happens with scarlet women, worse things by far are said of this dazzling wanton of the mushroom family than she deserves.) Mushrooms there are, such as the clathrus cancellatus, so strange of line and hue that he who for the first time sees them is struck incredulous: can such things really be?</p>

            <p>This love of Russians for the earthy tribe of mushrooms is, I suggest, a distinctive trait of the Slavs and a significant one. In the face of an ever mounting flood of printed matter and talk about Russia, that land remains for the English-speaking world as deep an enigma as ever. If among those who seek the key to the enigma there be some with an understanding heart and a poet&rsquo;s insight, let them lay aside for a while most of what is written and uttered, and consider the lesson in Russian history and Russian ways that the mushroom has to teach. Here is evidence of our visceral attachment to the bounteous soil that is our Mother Russia. In America, the hospitable land of my adoption, we sing hymns to our rocks and rills, to our wooded hills, but many, I think, sing with their voices and not with their hearts, for our rills we pollute and in our great paper mills we are speedily converting those wondrous forests into the stuff of which comics are made.</p>

            <p>In France and Italy the peasants know many of the mushrooms and possess a rich vocabulary for them. The Germanic peoples are less informed than the French, and there is evidence that what they know is of modern acquisition. But when the traveler reaches the lands of the northern Slavic peoples and the Lithuanians, the folk knowledge concerning mushrooms broadens and deepens until it reaches astonishing proportions. The Russians find it as natural to know the mushrooms and to avoid the deadly kinds as do most Americans to distinguish poison ivy from other creepers. Take our family for instance. We were Muscovites. My parents belonged to the Russian intelligentsia, and were city bred. We children spent most of our childhood in the immense cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and only our vacations in the country. Yet to no one in all Muscovy could it have seemed strange that Tanya and I, and all our little playmates, made ourselves useful, when in the country, by gathering various kinds of mushrooms and bringing them home in childish rivalry and glee to the kitchen. When we were naughty, our mother would punish us by forbidding us to go mushrooming.</p>

            <p>The Catskill Mountains in August are filled with mushrooms, exquisitely beautiful. (We Russians are always finding mushrooms wherever we go, even where our American friends tell us there are none.) In 1927 I had just married my American husband, and we were spending our first holiday in the lodge of Adam Dingwall, a friend, near Big Indian. With what astonishment my husband saw me, on our first walk, dart with ecstasy to this fungus and that, and on bended knee strike what seemed to him poses of adoration! With what horror he strove, unsuccessfully, to keep me from bringing home and eating a mess of fragrant <i>lisichki</i>! He behaved, as we both at once perceived, like the hen that has hatched ducklings and sees them swim away.</p>

            <p>An absorbing work, perhaps rich in historical significance, needs to be written on the role of the mushrooms in the life of the peoples of Europe. There are already many scientific treatises on mycology, as the study of the fungi is called, but none on the cultural implications of the mushroom world in the history of our European ancestors. For every region there should be determined which mushrooms are familiar to the people of the locality, and what names they use, and how they prepare them for food, and the folklore attaching to them. Our theme is elemental, reaching back into the folkways of pre-history, and such a mushroomic map of Europe might well confirm folk-ties hitherto merely suspected, and disclose others. If only one could travel today throughout the Slavic lands in the mushroom months, traveling close to the moist Mother Earth, gathering mushrooms with the peasants, identifying them by their local names, eating them according to local recipes, assembling the folklore about them, and trying to catch their delicate beauty of line and color with paint and brush! When I was a child, anyone with the inclination and leisure could have indulged in this idyllic pursuit to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>

            <p>To what a world of wonder and delight the fungal vocabulary of Russia transports us! Every mushroom, good or bad, comes under the general name of <i>grib.</i> When the farm-boy of the American prairies returns home after a hard day hungry for his &lsquo;grub&rsquo;, he is using in all likelihood a word with the same origin as the Russian peasant child who gathers his <i>griby</i> in the woods. Both words go back to a prehistoric root of the Indo&ndash;Germanic tribes that expressed the scratching and stirring and rooting and grubbing of the soil which gave to primitive man his vegetable food. Our archeologists piece together meanings deduced from the rubbed and worn artifacts of peoples who died long before the spoken word could be committed to posterity by writing. But the very words that those peoples spoke also come down to us, Likewise rubbed and worn, their sounds and meanings slowly changing on the tongues of numberless generations, yet still identifiable. In the linguistic cousinship of &lsquo;grub&rsquo; and the Russian <i>grib</i> we see one example, out of an infinite number, of the common cultural heritage that unites at the deepest levels the Slavs and the West, kindred stock of one great Indo&ndash;European family.</p>

            <p>Of the poisonous mushrooms, only one species in the Russian language bears a common name &mdash; the <i>mukhomor</i> or fly-killer, the amanita muscaria of science. In America this knave wears a yellow cap necked with warts, but throughout Europe its color is a splendid red, and only one blind to nature&rsquo;s warnings could be seduced by its meretricious allurements. All merely tasteless or insignificant mushrooms we dismiss with affectionate contempt under the term <i>poganki,</i> the &lsquo;unworthy ones&rsquo; or, as some interpret the word, &lsquo;little pagans&rsquo;.</p>

            <p>On the lowest level of culinary value we lump together a miscellaneous lot of gilled mushrooms by the name <i>syroezhki.</i> They can be eaten raw, as the name says, though seldom are they so eaten. To this humble group rightly belongs the common field mushroom, a poor thing owing its undeserved renown to a weakness in its character that makes it unique &mdash; it alone in the mushroom world of Europe and America stoops to man&rsquo;s will by lending itself to commercial cultivation in a big way.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp1-fn1" id="cp1-r1">[1]</a></sup> Among Great Russians, this people preeminent in &lsquo;mycophagy&rsquo; or mushroom-eating, the field mushroom enjoys little standing, not even possessing today a commonly used native name, being called <i>champignon</i> after the French. When gathered fresh in breeze-swept pastures, it still possesses traces of distinction, but through mass production on shelves in darkened cellars under controlled and uniform conditions the market product has long since lost such virtue as its wild ancestors once had, until today it is truly the slattern of the mushroom world, a sickly simulacrum of what mushrooms should be. (Actually, the cultivated mushroom and the field mushroom belong to different though closely related species. The beginnings of commercial cultivation offer a minor mystery. The French discovered the secret around Paris, whence the name <i>champignons de Paris,</i> but the exact time is unknown. There is a reference to them in <i>Le jardinier fran&ccedil;ois,</i> a book by N. de Bonnefons published in 1651. It seems likely that the art had sprung up in the previous half century. When Francis Bacon assembled his data for his <i>Sylva Sylvarum,</i> published in 1626, this well informed Englishman had never heard of cultivated mushrooms, for he wrote that a strange property of mushrooms is &lsquo;that they come up so hastily, as in a night, and yet they are unsowne&rsquo;. It is clear also that John Parkinson when he wrote his <i>Theatrum Botanicnm</i>, published in 1640, was similarly unaware of the procedures for inducing field mushrooms to grow.)</p>

            <p>Of the distinguished mushrooms, the first to appear in the spring of the year are the <i>smorchki,</i> or morels. They are not uncommon in America too, but in the New World they are gathered and relished almost solely by transplanted sons of Europe. This is especially remarkable since no one could mistake so distinctive a mushroom, standing erect as it does with its honey-combed top-knot exposing its windows to the breezes.</p>

            <p>Through summer and fall the variety of succulent mushrooms that Russians gather is considerable. In ascending order of excellence, we begin with the <i>opjonki,</i> the mushrooms that nourish on dead tree stumps. These are of various kinds, but the classical <i>opjonok,</i> or <i>opjonka,</i> is the common ink-cap, a delicate and lovely mushroom, the perfect expression in color and texture and line of transitory grace. For the span of a few hours these beautiful creatures, their highly convex bonnets supported on spindly legs, toss jauntily in the air, and then, by the action of their own enzymes, they curl up and dissolve into inky fluid. Large numbers often grow in a single colony, each day bringing forth a new generation. They must be cooked the instant they are gathered. More substantial is a second kind <i>of opjonka,</i> the armillariella mellea of the mycologists. Large and fleshy, they lend themselves to drying.They too grow in family clusters, but less populous than the ink-caps; in Italy the peasants by happy inspiration call them, with an affectionate diminutive, the Holy Family &mdash; <i>famigliola buona.</i></p>

            <p>The mushrooms with a moist and sticky surface, which the English-born person is quick to scorn as &ldquo;slimy&rdquo;, the Russians by a reverse semantic twist praise as the &lsquo;buttery ones&rsquo; &mdash; the &lsquo;fat-of-the-earth&rsquo;, as Samuel Collins, erstwhile physician to the Tsar, put it in his book, <i>The Present State of Russia,</i> published in 1671. These are the <i>masljonki</i> and <i>masljaniki</i> of the Russian kitchen, from the word <i>maslo,</i> meaning butter. Perhaps somewhat higher in the scale of merit are the <i>Hsichki</i> and the <i>ryzhiki</i> &mdash; the &lsquo;little foxes&rsquo; and the &lsquo;rusty ones&rsquo;. The former are the chanterelles of the West. Few are the sights that nature offers more gladdening to the eye of man than a colony of chanterelles on the shaded floor of an evergreen forest, their brilliant yellow cups spattering a carpet of dry, dun-colored needles. True, they dance not, but for Russians they laugh like dancing daffodils. With fluted stems, they look like yellow parasols, blown inside out. Good as they are to eat, their beauty in their native setting transcends their taste. With Russians the chanterelle holds a more humble place in the hierarchy of mushroom values than among some of the Western peoples who know their mushrooms less well. The folk of Norway and Sweden &mdash; countries that abound in mushroom life &mdash; think of the chanterelle as the one edible mushroom of the forests, which goes to prove that an abundance of mushrooms does not suffice to bring about familiarity with them. The chanterelle is common in America. It is pungent and unpalatable until cooked.</p>

            <p>For the table, in my opinion, the chanterelle must yield pride of place to the <i>ryzhik</i> &mdash; identified by the lexicons with the lactarius deliciosus but in fact embracing several of the edible lactarii &mdash; a fleshy mushroom whose funnel-shaped cap is handsomely marked by concentric rings of red. We Russians love our <i>ryzhiki.</i> This is the famous mushroom that we gather in immense quantities and eat with affection and gusto. We prepare it in many ways, but chiefly we like it salted and pickled. By tradition the various Finnish peoples are not mycophagous, but the peoples of Finland and Estonia have learned from the Russians in modern times to harvest the <i>ryzhiki</i> of the forests and add them to the family menu. <i>Ryzhik,</i> as we have said, means the &lsquo;rusty one&rsquo;, a name derived from the color of the cap. At the other end of Europe the Catalans in their language have hit on the identical figure of speech: thus the <i>rovello</i> of Barcelona is our <i>ryzhik</i> &mdash; the word means the same thing, and the mushroom is almost the same. The Catalan prizes this mushroom highest of all: he honors it above the <i>cepe de Bordeaux.</i> He puts his mess of <i>rovellons</i> into a frying pan of very hot oil, and on top of the mushrooms he adds tomatoes and garlic and parsley and sausage made from pork, and after cooking the whole for ten minutes or less over a slow fire, he sits down to a dish that he considers fit for the gods. In Spanish the name of this classic mushroom is the <i>mizcalo,</i> apparently a pre-Latin word, indigenous in Iberia, its verbal kinships lost in antiquity. The very antiquity of this word bears witness to the hold that the mushroom has on the people of Castile. The peasants in the noble Sierra de Credos, to the west of Madrid, know the <i>mizcalo</i> well: they harvest it regularly and sell the crop to gentlemen who come out from Madrid to buy it for re-sale elsewhere in Spain and abroad.</p>

            <p>As I said before, the lexicons tell us that the <i>ryzhik</i> is the mushroom known to science as the lactarius deliciosus. I shall let this identification pass for the present, merely remarking that a strange confusion bedevils the terminology here, a confusion that must be laid at the door of a naturalist who blundered. Later I shall try to untangle the error.</p>


            <p>The <i>gruzd</i> are another famous mushroom tribe in northern Russia. This is the name properly belonging to the large, white, fleshy lactarius piperatus, but apparently some Russians also use it for other lactarii and even some russulae. The word itself is peculiar to the Russian language (including White Russian and Ukrainian), being unknown elsewhere in the Slavic world. It is an honored name in our mushroom vocabulary, though rather for its role in folklore and proverbs, where the <i>gruzd</i> is the captain of the mushroom host <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp1-fn2" id="cp1-r2">[2]</a></sup> than as a table delicacy.</p>


            <p>With the <i>ryzhik</i> and the <i>gruzd</i> we leave behind the whole tribe of gilled mushrooms and ascend the scale of values to the best varieties of the numerous genera of boleti. These are the mushrooms that, instead of radial gins on the underside of the cap, display sponge-like pores. Two of them that are esteemed by all Russians are the <i>berjozovik</i> (or <i>podberjozovik)</i> and the <i>podosinovik</i>, and concerning them there is a singular fact to be disclosed.</p>

            <p>In recent times the mycologists of the West have discovered that an intimate tie of mutual help links certain mushrooms to certain kinds of trees, each of such mushroom species being thus related to one or more kinds of trees. These mushrooms may assume a slightly different appearance according to the kind of tree the individual specimen lives with. For this relationship to be understood, one must keep in mind that the mushrooms we see in woods and fields are merely the fruit thrown to the surface when all conditions are right: the life of these elementary organisms goes on chiefly underground; indeed, in the case of truffles, entirely so. Just as the therapeutic potency of certain moulds has been discovered only in this century, so the importance of mushrooms in life&rsquo;s great round begins now to be discerned. We know that the rootlets of many trees are often locked in symbiotic embrace with the subterranean &lsquo;mycelium&rsquo; of the mushroom, and for this intimacy the mycologists have invented their special word &mdash; &lsquo;mycorrhiza&rsquo;, from the Greek words for fungus and root.</p>
            
            <p>The painstaking observations of mycologists have proved that between the birch tree and the boletus scaber there is such a relationship, and similarly between the aspen and the European boletus rufus. Now it is an arresting fact, of which mycologists in the West are usually unaware, that the folk names in Russian for these very species of mushrooms are keyed to those same trees: the <i>berjozovik</i> lives with the <i>berjoza</i>, or birch tree; and the <i>podosinovik</i> grows under the <i>osina</i>, or aspen. The <i>berjozovik</i> is the boletus scaber, and <i>the podosinovik</i> is the boletus rufus. The scientists now confirm what the peasants of Eastern Europe have sensed from time immemorial. The <i>berjozovik,</i> incidentally, is abundant in America, but in my opinion the true <i>podosinovik</i> does not occur here, and those that are gathered and eaten as such by Russians in the United States belong to other species somewhat resembling the red-capped aspen mushroom of Europe. There is also in Russia a rare blue-capped <i>podosinovik,</i> whose scientific name I do not know: it would be interesting to identify it, to see whether the mycologists have yet confirmed its link with the aspen tree.</p> <p>Ranking above all the mushrooms so far mentioned come those aristocrats of the mushroom world, the <i>belye griby</i> or &lsquo;white mushrooms&rsquo;, known to the French as the <i>cepes de Bordeaux</i> and to the mycologist as the boletus edulis. These are the most famous of common mushrooms, the delight of epicures, the &lsquo;cep&rsquo; of English gourmets. The Russians call them &lsquo;white&rsquo;, not primarily because their flesh is white, but because in the Russian language &lsquo;white&rsquo; connotes excellence.</p>

            <p>And right here we come upon another of the strange parallels in fungal imagery that recur between peoples geographically and culturally remote from one another. We have seen that both the Russians and Catalans speak of certain lactarii as the &lsquo;rusty ones&rsquo;. Now we observe that the Basques of Guipuzcoa, Upper Navarre, and the Labourd refer to the dun-colored cep as the &lsquo;white mushroom&rsquo;, just as the Russians do, the Basque term being <i>ondo zuri</i>. We have said that &lsquo;white&rsquo; connotes excellence, but perhaps this is an understatement. There is an abundance of evidence that the primitive peoples of the Eurasian land mass, no matter how different culturally, were prone to associate whiteness and brightness with divinity, with the &lsquo;White Goddess&rsquo; (as Robert Graves calls this creature), who possessed myriad shapes and names. Is it possible that in the &lsquo;white mushroom&rsquo; of the Russians and Basques we discover a survival of a primitive divine kinship.</p>

            <p>Truly senatorial in girth and mass, the splendid white mushroom or cep is supreme in fragrance and taste. It lends itself to pickling and drying, so that it keeps indefinitely and then may be served in soups and sauces. This is the mushroom that Russians used to eat in Lent in lieu of meat: little wonder that no one shrank from Lenten fare!<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp1-fn3" id="cp1-r3">[3]</a></sup> This is the mushroom, packaged in cellophane envelopes, that is to be found on sale in the little Jewish food shops of New York. (How lovable are those shops, in the immense variety of their stores and the warmth of the welcome that the owners, hailing as they almost always do from Eastern Europe, extend to appreciative customers, and especially to Russians!) During the recent war with Germany, the importation of these mushrooms was interrupted, but new sources sprang up in Chile. The quality, however, was not the same, and with the return of peace, the flow of mushrooms from Poland and Italy was resumed. In New York there is one firm, the Reliable Mushroom Company in Rivington Street, that confines its business to dealing in these imported dried mushrooms. In November 1948 I priced the various grades that Mr. Fessel was offering: the shredded Chilean mushrooms were $2.75 a pound and the Italian were $4.00; but the long and handsome strings of dried Polish ceps were $6.00. In December 1950 the Polish product had risen to $8.00, and for caps alone (the stems being considered inferior and removed) the price was $12, but a year later, in October 1951, the market for these caps had fallen to $8.</p>

            <p>In New York the cep is for sale only in its desiccated state, though it grows throughout the wooded countryside; and those who know it only dried will never divine the delicacy and richness of its taste when pickled in brine, or marinated, or preserved by boiling and sealing in jars, or better far, when fried fresh in butter, or, finally and best of all, sauteed in sour cream.</p>

            <p>I respectfully suggest to the Wine and Food Society that some day they arrange to serve to their members, artfully prepared, a selection of all the mushrooms I have mentioned, accompanied of course by appropriate wines, and I predict that by a vote resembling a Soviet election the choice will run to the incomparable <i>belye griby</i>. I am not unmindful of the difficulties in arraging such an extraordinary culinary event. All the mushrooms must be served fresh, to do them all equal justice. A generous mess of the most ephemeral &mdash; the <i>opjonki</i> would have to be rushed in at the last moment from close by, of course with motorcycle escort, sirens whining. A chef would be cooking them in a chafing dish en route. Other kinds of mushrooms would hail from Europe by plane. The chef in charge would thoroughly understand the personality of each of the kinds, and possess the skill to evoke its proper character. Nobly served, what a memorable spread we should have, and what a tribute to the folk-cookery of the Slavs!</p>

            <p>I have one more name to add to the honor roll of the Russian mushroom world. If the <i>belye griby</i> are the aristocrats of that world, then the serene dignity of Prince must be bestowed on the <i>borovik.</i> By ancient tradition and common consent, it leads the roster. The Czechs, who vie with us in our enthusiasm for it, call it the Regal Mushroom, or <i>hfib krdlovsky.</i> Some Frenchmen know it too. They use for it various names &mdash; <i>tete de negre, cepe polonais, gendarme noir</i>, and <i>cepe bronze.</i> The name that the mycologists use is boletus asreus. Apparently it does not occur in the New World.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp1-fn4" id="cp1-r4">[4]</a></sup> It is rare in Russia, so rare that many Russians apply the famous name erroneously to its close relative, the <i>belyi grib.</i> Perhaps it is not a distinct species, but only a variant of the other, a variant linked symbiotically with some kind of pine tree, for <i>bor</i> means pine-forest. The <i>borovik</i> owes its supreme rating with us to its rarity and to its breathtaking beauty: its &lsquo;head&rsquo; (for one refrains from speaking of the &lsquo;cap&rsquo; of such a majestic creature) is a deep brown approaching black, and in size and weight and stature it is the equal of the <i>belyi grib</i>. In fragrance and taste, perhaps only the most knowing epicures can distinguish the two, but however closely related the two kinds may be, and however much they look alike, to the <i>borovik</i> belongs the dignity of first place in the whole mushroom world.</p>

            <p>The Russians never discuss the weather to make conversation, and our lack of interest in golf scores and sporting events generally, both amateur and professional, is complete. But mushrooms are different. They are not only raw material for the kitchen, they are a theme for endless discussion. They are ever present in our minds, even when we are not discussing them. They are so taken for granted that Russian authors seldom stop to discuss them systematically. But references to them are scattered everywhere in Russian literature &mdash; in poetry, fiction, essays. Three times in <i>Anna Karenina</i> does Leo Tolstoy bring them into his narrative, and the episodes, for the perceptive reader, are extraordinarily revealing. In one, a nursery full of tearful little children is turned in an instant from tears to joyous excitement with the announcement that they are to go mushrooming. The second episode, for our purpose, is even more startling. A land-owner is preparing to propose to a girl he loves, and with this intention goes into the woods to join her where she is gathering mushrooms. But he never gets to the point of proposing, for they begin by discussing mushrooms, and though both are longing to speak of love, once they are on mushrooms, like a cracked record they cannot get off that subject! In Appendix I we offer to our readers a rendering of these two passages from <i>Anna Karenina.</i> The third episode, though slight, is perhaps the most touching. The land-owner Levin goes out into his fields, where his peasants are mowing the hay, to join them in their labor. The day is hot and long and the work is hard, but they all press on to finish a big stint. As twilight comes they find themselves cutting grass among the trees of a wood where birch-mushrooms abound, big fellows that have fattened on the moist humus of the grassy places. In their rhythmic sweep the scythes cut the mushrooms as well as the grass. Levin, exhausted though he is by his unwonted effort, nevertheless notices that the oldest of the peasants, a grand old man who excels all the others in grace and endurance, never fails to lean over and pick up the mushroom that his blade has severed, then tucking it away in the fold of his blouse. "Another present for my old woman," he says. His scythe does not miss a single blade of grass, nor does a single mushroom escape him.</p>

            <p>There are delightful verses about mushrooms in the poems of two of Russia&rsquo;s more accomplished poets, Lev Alexandrovich Mej and Viktor Vladimirovich Khlebnikov. I like particularly Khlebnikov&rsquo;s apostrophe to the mushrooms of the forest. The poetic virtue of his lines is lost in this literal translation:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Here are <i>syroezhki</i> and the russet <i>ryzhik</i><br />
                    With raspberry blood,<br />
                    Yellow <i>gruzd&rsquo;</i>, round and shaggy,<br />
                    And you, <i>pecheritza,</i><br />
                    Simple and white like snow,<br />
                    And the firm white ones with the thick caps.<br />
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The &lsquo;firm white ones&rsquo; are ceps of course, the thick-capped <i>belye griby</i>. Of special interest is Khlebnikov&rsquo;s description of the <i>ryzhik</i> as &lsquo;raspberry-blooded&rsquo;. All the lexicons say that the <i>ryzhik</i> is the lactarius deliciosus, a mediocre mushroom that exudes saffron drops. It is clear that the <i>ryzhik</i> of Khlebnikov is a variant, a lactarius that drips raspberry blood &mdash; <i>malinovaja krov&rsquo;</i>.</p>

            <p>Yet another Russian author, Sergej Timofeevich Aksakov, late in his life wrote about mushrooms in a lovely essay that is little known. It merits attention for several reasons, and in Appendix II we present what we believe is the first translation of it.</p>

            <p>The addiction to mushroom gathering is not a badge of politics or ideology. There was Aksakov, a superb figure of Old Russia. But there was also Lenin, whose fanaticism brought endless woe on Russia and the world, but whose dedication to wild mushroom hunting during one brief spell shows him hi a more winning light. His wife Nadezhda Krupskaja wrote in a letter hi 1916 that he pretended to know nothing about wild mushrooms and to care less, but in fact he was seized at that time with a veritable passion for mushroom gathering. (He was possessed of a <i>razh&rsquo;</i>, as she put it.) One day hi that fateful summer of 1916 they were hurrying along a mountain trail near Zurich to catch their train. A drizzle soon turned into a downpour. Suddenly among the trees Lenin caught sight of ceps. At once he turned aside after them, paying no attention to the wet. &ldquo;We were drenched to the very marrow of our bones and of course missed our train.&rdquo; He did not quit until his sack was full and his <i>razh&rsquo;</i> was quenched.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp1-fn5" id="cp1-r5">[5]</a></sup></p>

            <p>By the Russian scale of values, all the wonderful golf courses of vast America are inviting more for the mushrooms that grow on them and in the woods along their well-tended borders, than for the game. You can always tell a Russian when you see her hi wooded country: she progresses slowly, stooping and peering to right and left, with a low, circular, sweeping glance, as though she has lost something. She is armed with a hamper and a walking stick to poke here and there; and she springs forward occasionally with a happy pounce and kneels to gather in the prize.</p>

            <p>When the Russian child learns his alphabet, he sees by a picture that &lsquo;g&rsquo; stands for <i>grib</i> this has been habitual at least since the zyth century. In his primer he reads of mushrooms. In his school he is like to find a playmate whose family name is taken from some mushroom, a boy named Gribov, for example, or a Gribunin, or a Borovikov, or a Gruzdjov, or aRyzhikov, or an Opjonkin, or a Syroezhkovskij, or a Lisichkin. The Maslenikovs are common, but that name might also be derived from the trade of the butter-churner. I am told that in Russia there are even Mukhomorovs, but I myself have never run into this equivocal name. In the time of Catherine the Great there was a famous painter named Borovikovskij, and a generation later the leading playwright was Griboyedov, &lsquo;Mr. Mushroomeaterson&rsquo;. Was there ever such a name in English, or a Mycophagenes in ancient Greece? In English the only parallel that I recall is the fine old medieval family name of Norman origin, still current I believe, of Muschampe, named after some field or meadow famous for its <i>mousserons</i> or mushrooms. At the imperial University of St. Petersburg there used to be a professor of law named Gribovskij who would sign his articles with the pseudonym &lsquo;Muketov&rsquo;, thus giving a Greek twist to his Russian name.</p>

            <p>Before long the Russian youngster learns by heart the stanzas of the childish mushroom marching poem, &lsquo;Panic among the Mushrooms&rsquo;<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp1-fn6" id="cp1-r6">[6]</a></sup>, wherein Colonel <i>Borovik,</i> Commander-in-Chief of the mushroom host, summons his minions to war. The red-coated <i>mukhomory</i> decline to serve, for they are senators. The <i>beljanki</i> say no, for they are aristocratic ladies and exempt. The <i>opjonki</i> refuse, since they must do duty as ladies-in-waiting. The morels beg off, for they are gray-headed oldsters. The <i>maslyata</i> say they are needed in the factories, the ink-caps point to their spindly legs, the <i>volnushki</i> call themselves old dowagers, and the <i>lisichki</i> profess to be nuns. The <i>ryzliiki</i> are just simple peasant folk and useless as soldiers, and the <i>volui</i> duck their duty by reminding the Colonel that they are nothing but the village loafers. Then up step the valiant <i>gruzdi</i>, willing fellows, who will gladly go to war and smite the enemy. And so, with a loud &lsquo;Oo-rah! oo-rah! oo-rah!&rsquo;, off they march. These stanzas with their shrewd comments on the diverse species are the didactic and mnemonic device by which a people&rsquo;s rich mushroom lore is passed on to the next generation. Based I think on them, I recall a children&rsquo;s ballet and chorale impersonating the mushroom population; was it not composed by Cesar Cui, or perhaps Rebikov? The Czech composer Leos Janacek near the end of his opera, Li ska Bystrouska, &lsquo;The Cunning Fox&rsquo;, has the Forester sing a lovely aria to the mushrooms as he goes through the woods.</p>

            <p>No people talk and write more, or more enthusiastically, about good food than the Russians, and soon or late their conversation turns to mushrooms. Has the season been good? Who has found the biggest lot of the best kinds? What about the best ways of preserving and cooking? In the Russian language the common term for a warm, soft rain in summer is &lsquo;mushroom-rain&rsquo; &mdash; gribnoi dozhd&rsquo; &mdash; used even when mushrooms are not under discussion. Among the country-folk, by immemorial right, the peasant who discovers a spot where morels or &lsquo;white mushrooms&rsquo; abound, enjoys thereafter a first claim on the crop in that area. City folk who summer in the country eye one another furtively on their mushroom sorties, like rival spies intent on each other&rsquo;s secrets, and those who hit on good colonies often guard their secret jealously. The Czechs are also notable fanciers of mushrooms, vying in their enthusiasm with the Russians, and the Poles do not lag far behind. The outstanding Polish poet, Adam Mickiewicz, in the third book of his masterpiece, Pan Tadeusz, devotes some lines of unforgettable beauty to the gathering of wild mushrooms. But as a Russian I remark that he pays obeisance only to the Hsichki, the boroviki, and the ryzhiki. Of the others he goes on to say that the people despise them. Not thus does a Russian speak. Another Pole, Stanislaw Trembecki, a conspicuous literary figure in the Polish classicist period in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, penned an astonishing diatribe against mushroom-eaters. He was a learned crank, to be sure, but belligerency on this theme has no parallel among Russians, not even Russian cranks.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp1-fn7" id="cp1-r7">[7]</a></sup> Of course it is wrong to generalize from the utterances of intellectuals, and the peasants of Poland may well be free from the mycophobia that has infected Polish men of letters, but we are constrained to point out that as early as the 17<sup>th</sup> century that eminent Polish poet, a master of the baroque school, Waclaw Potocki, in &lsquo;The Unweeded Garden&rsquo; discusses wild mushrooms at some length, and the tenor of what he says is that mushrooms are an esoteric business, best left to the few who know the secrets!</p>

            <p>Close to forty years have passed since I last gathered mushrooms in Russia, and reveled in the mushroom lore that we all shared. As I re-read the lines I have written, I become aware of receding planes of memory, on the periphery of my consciousness, strewn with visions of mushrooms that I can no longer identify by name, and with names of mushrooms that are no longer attached to clearly defined images. What were those <i>beljanki</i> that refused to go to war because they were aristocratic ladies? The <strong>volui</strong> of the poem &mdash; <i>vol</i> means &lsquo;ox&rsquo;, and these are therefore &lsquo;bovine-mushrooms&rsquo; &mdash; were, I remember, a lowly species, unwholesome until cooked, and utilized only in the absence of anything better. Then there were the <i>volnushki,</i> which might mean the &lsquo;wavy ones&rsquo;, but are more likely another &lsquo;bovine&rsquo; species; the <i>sinjushki</i> or blue-capped ones; the <i>svinushki</i> or swine-mushrooms; the <i>bolotovik</i> or swamp-mushroom; the <i>dubovik</i> or oak-mushroom; and the <i>elovik</i> or balsam-mushroom. There was the <i>mokhovnik</i> or moss-mushroom. There was a big, ugly mushroom that grew in isolation and was never gathered: the <i>kozjol</i> or goat. The puff ball was the Devil&rsquo;s pepper-pot &mdash; <i>chortova perechnitza</i>. There was <i>thegolubetz</i> or pigeon mushroom, and the <i>obabka</i>, of which only the name floats uncertainly to me. From earliest childhood I recall another curious name &mdash; the <i>skripitza,</i> or screeching mushroom: what could it have been? Gogol&rsquo;s immortal character in <i>Old World</i> <i>Squires,</i> Pul&rsquo;kheria Ivanovna, once started to tell how to preserve in vinegar a mushroom that she called the <i>travjanka</i>. She had just reached the point where she had lined her keg with oak leaves and saltpeter and added some blossoms of the bird-cherry tree, the Russian <i>cherjomukha,</i> which the botanists call the padus avium, when she was diverted. (What can the world do about mischievous Persons from Porlock?) Never shall we know the rest of that enticing recipe, but someone at least can identify for us the <i>travjanka</i>.</p>

            <p>One of the loveliest mushroom stories is the legend about their origin that we find in Bohemia, which we retell from the recension recorded by the Czech folklorist, Mrs. Bozena Nemcova.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#cp1-fn8" id="cp1-r8">[8]</a></sup> It seems that Jesus and Peter were passing through a Czech village and heard the sound of wedding music in a humble cottage. They joined the party, but not before Jesus had warned Peter to accept no food save only bread and salt, for the people were poor. Jesus and Peter were made most welcome. They partook of the bread and salt that were offered to them, declining however the cakes <i>[koldce]</i>. But a little later, when no one was looking, Peter slipped some cakes into his pouch. After a while Jesus and Peter continued on their way, Jesus immersed in his thoughts and Peter lagging behind, that he might nibble on his cakes. But at each bite, Jesus would wheel around and ask him what he was eating. Peter would spit out the mouthful and reply, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; This happened again and again, until there was no cake left. Then Jesus said to Peter, &ldquo;Go back, and pick up all that you have spat out, and I will wait for you.&rdquo; When Peter returned he said to Jesus, &ldquo;I found nothing except this that I show you. I thought it was food, but lo! it was a growth, rooted in the soil.&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;It is a growth, and it grew from the food you threw away.&rdquo; Then Peter asked for forgiveness, and it was granted to him. Then they went to the cottage of a poor woman and asked her to cook what Peter had found, and it turned out to be mushrooms, and they were good. Because the mushrooms had sprung from the food of poor people, Jesus bestowed them on the poor, and he taught the poor woman where to seek them. And because poor people need help, mushrooms multiply and abound. And because Peter, eating them, nevertheless remained hungry, mushrooms are not filling.</p>

            <p>When we consider how gingerly even mycologists in America ofttimes handle the run of miscellaneous mushrooms gathered in fields and woods, the self-assurance of Russians as they by-pass the poisonous and foul-tasting ones, and grade the others according to their edible merits, and consume these wild mushrooms with impunity as an important ingredient in their daily diet, seems astonishing to other peoples. Here is a notable instance where folk-wisdom anticipates and overreaches the savants. I have surely strained the patience of my readers with the Russian vocabulary that I have recalled for the mushroom tribe, but there must be an endless glossary of other names that I have forgotten or never known. The wealth of the Russian nomenclature for the mushrooms is a measure of the role they have played in the social history of the Russian people. The names evoke for Russians the edible qualities of the various kinds, but semantically they refer primarily to the habitat and essential character of the species. Several of the folk-names for mushrooms in the Russian language could have come into acceptance only after age-long intimacy. The scientific nomenclature of the Western mycologists, devised over the past century, is superficial by comparison with some of the Russian common names, the pseudo-classical terms of the scientists being keyed often to accidental attributes, the aspects that the untutored eye of the early mycologist first remarked.</p>

            <p>In the English language the very word &lsquo;fungi&rsquo; is an ugly, half-assimilated alien, detached and cold in its emotional personality; and apart from it there are in the common speech only &lsquo;mushroom&rsquo; for the species that lends itself to cultivation and &lsquo;toadstool&rsquo; of evil aura. &lsquo;Toadstool&rsquo; has no precise meaning, but in ordinary usage it embraces all the wild mushrooms that the person born in the English-speaking world does not know and therefore fears and loathes. It is a word that most of those who love mushrooms refrain from using. Even if viewed as a fanciful term, it is inept, surviving only through the inadvertence of a great people whose attention has been elsewhere. With this single word &lsquo;toadstool&rsquo;, soaked in condescension and repugnance, the English-speaking world lumps together and dismisses without a second glance some of the richest and most varied embroidery doing honor to wild nature&rsquo;s glorious vesture.</p>
